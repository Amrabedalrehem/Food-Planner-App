📝 Description

Food Planner is an Android mobile application designed to help users plan and manage their weekly meals in an easy and organized way.
The application allows users to explore meal categories, search for meals using multiple criteria, and get daily meal inspiration.

Users can save their favorite meals locally and access them even without an internet connection.
Additionally, the app provides a secure synchronization mechanism using Firebase, allowing users to back up their data and restore it upon login.

The application is built with an offline-first approach and integrates *TheMealDB API* to provide rich and detailed meal information.
This project was developed with a strong focus on clean architecture, data synchronization, and user experience.
